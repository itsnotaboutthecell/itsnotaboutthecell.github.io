#### **About the site**

I’m selfish. I **want** you to be great. I’m going to repeat that so I have clarity - **I need you to be great**. Because the lessons you learn now will be the spreadsheet and data model that someone else will manage when you have left this earth (and hopefully the role you are currently in as the promotions come raining down upon you). The success of your work is not built in pretty charts or intricate formulas but in how it stands the true test of time (or Office Update).

If you're looking for a simple trick to scale the Mt. Everest that is Power BI or Excel this may not be the droid you're looking for. It's Not About The Cell is all about the long game and rewiring the thought process for those who desire proficiency.
