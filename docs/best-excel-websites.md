Most people have posters of [Muhammad Ali](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/tumblr_lryw5nTmQC1r34zkwo1_500.jpg), [Wayne Gretzky](https://bestpracticelife.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/you-miss-100-of-the-shots-you-dont-take-blog-photo.jpg) or [Ric Flair](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/05/b2/35/05b235f539ae5a5acc15c73ee86acc3e.jpg) hanging on their walls to provide them inspiration, I have posters of the following Excel contributors' spreadsheets.

### **John Walkenbach**

Website: [http://spreadsheetpage.com/](http://spreadsheetpage.com/)

I describe John as a meat and potatoes Excel guy, be prepared to fill up on the in-depth information as to the "**WHY**" we do the things we do in Excel, not just the "**HOW TO**".

### **Oz D du Soleil**

Website: [Excel on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/user/WalrusCandy)

Chicago Bears fan and master of the ghost pepper, Oz speaks from the heart and makes Excel relatable and enjoyable with his unique personality.

### Excel TV

Website: [http://www.excel.tv](http://www.excel.tv)

The premier website for a who's who in the Excel community. Engaging conversations and live content make this a must-see event.

### Ken Puls

Website: [https://www.excelguru.ca/blog/](https://www.excelguru.ca/blog/)

I danced around Ken's site for quite some time when I needed Power Query help. It wasn't until I decided to get back to basics and sit down with his ["M is For Data Monkey"](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Monkey-Guide-Language-Excel/dp/1615470344) that I finally saw the light. I probably tweet [@kpuls](https://twitter.com/kpuls) more than anyone on Twitter each time I have an "Ah-Ha!" moment in Power Query.

### **Charles Williams**

Website: [https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/](https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/)

Constantly trying to push the boundaries of Excel's speed limitations Charles provides a very high level of analysis of what's going on under Excels' engine. I'm just as lost as the next person sometimes but I greatly appreciate his contributions to the community.

### E90E50

Website: [https://sites.google.com/site/e90e50charts/](https://sites.google.com/site/e90e50charts/)

Some of the most mind-bending visualizations you will ever see in Excel. Anything that I write here will do this site no justice.
