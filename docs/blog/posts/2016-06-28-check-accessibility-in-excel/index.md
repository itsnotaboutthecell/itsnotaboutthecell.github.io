The founding fathers of Multiplan intended that spreadsheets would be for everyone: the rich and the poor, the data analyst and the data scientist, the sighted and the vision impaired. Often, things that we take for granted make a world of difference to others. Take the appropriate steps now to ensure that your work is up to accessibility standards.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt served four terms as President Of The United States of America. Claude Monet painted his famous [Les Nymphéas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_\(Monet_series\)). Stevie Wonder shaped [modern music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wZ3ZG_Wams) with over 25 Grammy awards. All three dealt with varying degrees of vision impairment. Perspective is not limited to your visual perception, it's in the way you experience information and the stories you are able to share. There's no excuse for your spreadsheets to be any different.
