This is a lot when considered all at once, so take it one cell at a time.</p> <p>Understanding\u00a0what each data type means will eventually tie into your ability to manipulate data to meet your needs. For right now, it's less important for you to know\u00a0every type structure and more about understanding what I like to call \"The Big Four\".

Good - that means you've stepped into that 50% of the program that most people dare not traverse. I know you have an idea of what text is as you read this and I'm positive\u00a0you know what a number is, but what is a function? A function is a group of statements that together perform a task.</p> <p>Functions are comprised of four parts:</p> <ul> <li>Name<ul> <li>A predefined name to invoke a\u00a0function</li> </ul> </li> <li>Arguments<ul> <li>The\u00a0values (parameters) passed through a functions procedures.<ul> <li>Additionally the formula helper lists the number of arguments that must be completed to successfully return a value</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Return Type<ul> <li>The data type a function returns</li> </ul> </li> <li>Function Body<ul> <li>A procedural list of statements\u00a0that must be performed to\u00a0return a value in accordance with the return type</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I believe not enough emphasis is placed on the return type of a function when learning Excel, instead we've been conditioned to simply insert the parameters\u00a0necessary to complete the function body's syntax, cross our fingers and hope that a value is returned.</p> <p>Let's compare two functions using the same variables:</p> <ul> <li>\"Die Hard \", 3</li> </ul> <p>Function:\u00a0CONCATENATE</p> <p>Describe It:</p> <ul> <li>Joins several text strings into one text string</li> </ul> <p>Syntax:</p> <ul> <li>\\=CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)</li> </ul> <p>Return Type: Text</p> <p>Formula: </p> <ul> <li>\\=CONCATENATE(\"Die Hard \", 3)</li> </ul> <p>Function:\u00a0SUM</p> <p>Describe It:</p> <ul> <li>Adds all the numbers in a range of cells</li> </ul> <p>Syntax:</p> <ul> <li>\\=SUM(number1, [number2], ...)</li> </ul> <p>Return Type:\u00a0Number</p> <p>Syntax:</p> <ul> <li>\\=SUM(\"Die Hard \", 3)</li> </ul> <p>Just spit-balling right\u00a0now:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The CONCATENATE\u00a0function's return type is text\u00a0- it will convert any data type into text and return as text\u00a0for example \"Die Hard 3\"</p> </li> <li> <p>The SUM function's return type is a number -\u00a0it requires the functions parameters to be any of the number data type structures - if you try to add the data types Text and Number together you will receive the error handling message of #VALUE! due to incompatible information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You already know these\u00a0things in the real world, all we are doing now is understanding\u00a0how your computer interprets them.</p> <p>Let's go ahead and bring it on home now by discussing what's\u00a0going on each time you\u00a0pass a formula through an Excel function. First off you call the function by typing \"=\" then the function\u00a0name EXACT\u00a0whose parameters are text1 as the\u00a0text\u00a0data\u00a0structure string\u00a0and text2 as the\u00a0text\u00a0data\u00a0structure string\u00a0with an expected return type of Boolean (TRUE | FALSE).

For instance a record of 25 divided by the maximum record of 25 would equal 1, but by adding one digit more you can ensure that it will never achieve a whole number.</p>","tags":["array","cse","data","excel","indexmatch","large","max","microsoft-excel","name-manager","not","rank","rept","row","spreadsheet"]},{"location":"blog/2017/05/29/im-unsure-how-official-this-ranking-system-really-is/#alright-alright-alright","title":"Alright, alright, alright...","text":"","tags":["array","cse","data","excel","indexmatch","large","max","microsoft-excel","name-manager","not","rank","rept","row","spreadsheet"]},{"location":"blog/2017/05/29/im-unsure-how-official-this-ranking-system-really-is/#each-movie-now-has-a-unique-rating","title":"Each movie now has a unique rating.","text":"<p>Change It:</p> <ul> <li>Field: [Rank]</li> <li>\\=IFERROR(RANK([@[Unique Rating]],[Unique Rating]),\"\")</li> </ul>","tags":["array","cse","data","excel","indexmatch","large","max","microsoft-excel","name-manager","not","rank","rept","row","spreadsheet"]},{"location":"blog/2017/05/29/im-unsure-how-official-this-ranking-system-really-is/#its-all-about-position","title":"It's All About Position","text":"<p>Now that our movie ratings are all unique, let's concentrate on removing duplicate years and genres.

If you look back at the formula and\u00a0the value is only found in the array once, return the current row's year.

This will show you that Power Query defaults everything to Int64.Type for you.</p> <pre><code>let\n    Source = #table(\n        type table [Int8 = Int8.Type],\n        List.Transform({-127..128}, each {_})\n    )\nin\n    Source\n</code></pre> <p>As my great friend Microsoft Excel now shows, 256 rows were loaded with 1 error because the 256th row was outside the boundary of allowed values for 8-bit integers. However, it didn\u2019t stop the table object from creating that row with an empty value though, as displayed by the icon in the bottom right. This same behavior is across all the Power Query hosts (Excel, Power BI, Power Apps, etc.)</p> <p></p> <p>Ok, so now exploring Dataflows Gen2 - we\u2019re storing outputs in Delta format (parquet) and with that we have a bit more data types to work with specifically IntegerType() and LongType(). I wanted to see if we did anything different in this new crazy world of rich file formats with this simple code block below that adds four columns, one for each integer type and then some values across each.</p> <p>Now my question/hypothesis/theory is \u201cWill Dataflows Gen2 / Power Query use the IntegerType for anything 32-bit or smaller or will everything default to the LongType?\u201d Get your bets in now folks!\"</p> <pre><code>let\n    Source = #table(\n        type table [Int8 = Int8.Type, Int16 = Int16.Type, Int32.Type, Int64.Type], {{1, 100, 1000, 1000000}}\n    )\nin\n    Source\n</code></pre> <p>And with a simple df.schema operation in a notebook, I can see my delta table has all my columns stored as LongType() which allows that maximum value range for integers.</p> <p></p> <p>People smarter than me have already written articles and I\u2019m sure some others will leave comments on this post with more details with respect to performance and optimization and what this potentially means for your solutions long term.</p> <p>But I thought this was an interesting behavior, though from previous experience, one I was expecting.</p>","tags":["excel","microsoft-fabric","power-query"]},{"location":"blog/2023/10/17/change-in-the-house-of-lakes/","title":"CHANGE (IN THE HOUSE OF LAKES)","text":"<p>Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric is an AMAZING tool that allows us to combine the flexibility of Data pipelines and ease of a Dataflow Gen2 to create some nifty solutions with a tiny smidge of code. One of the most common use cases is the ability to load new data into a destination for a select period (incrementally). Below is a high-level diagram that we\u2019ll start breaking down to copy data from a SQL Database into a Lakehouse.</p> <p></p> <p>To get started, create a new Warehouse item and execute the below SQL query to create a stored procedure. For the purposes of this example, I\u2019m using date only but please feel free to adjust as needed for datetime. (I\u2019ll be highlighting why I started with date only while leveraging the world\u2019s most popular language Power Query M a bit later\u2026)</p> <pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE IncrementRefresh @DateValue DATE\nAS\n\nDROP TABLE dbo.IrDate;\n\nCREATE TABLE dbo.IrDate (\n    DateValue DATE\n);\n\nINSERT INTO dbo.IrDate (DateValue)\nVALUES (@DateValue);\n\nGO;\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>We'll now execute our stored procedure to add a single date value into our table and view the results once complete.</p> <pre><code>EXEC IncrementRefresh @DateValue = '2018-06-01';\n\nSELECT * FROM dbo.IrDate;\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Next, create a Dataflow Gen2 and a new query using Get data &gt; from Warehouse. Connect to the table that contains our date value and select Drill down to convert the query into a scalar value.</p> <p>Also, create another query using Get data &gt; from SQL Server for the table you want to setup an incremental refresh with (this could be any data source in your case, preferably one that that supports query folding).</p> <p></p> <p>To avoid refreshing fact tables that may take forever to complete with large volumes, we\u2019ll go for a specific period using the date/datetime columns and set a static filter for Equals... and then jump into the formula bar for a small bit of Power Query M later.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, let\u2019s set up a static filter for equals on the date/datetime columns in the Filter rows window. Type in any static value and select OK - we\u2019ll update this using the scalar value from our Warehouse in the next portion.</p> <p></p> <p>To update the formula, we\u2019ll replace the #datetime(yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss) value with the scalar value from our IrDate query and cast it to a datetime type using DateTime.From function.</p> <pre><code>Table.SelectRows(#\"Remove Columns\", each [ModifiedDate] = DateTime.From(IrDate))\n</code></pre> <p>\"I can hear you wondering why we didn\u2019t cast it appropriately at the beginning?!\" The reason is that I wanted to show you the full flexibility of adjusting your solution. If you ever need to modify this in the future, you can leverage Power Query M functions like (Date.IsInCurrentMonth, Date.Month, etc.)</p> <p></p> <p>Now that we\u2019ve set up our filter, there are a few more important things to do. Right-click each query and deselect the \u201cEnable staging\u201d option. Why? Because both the sources Warehouse and SQL Database support query folding - no need for all that Fabric compute to process heavy transformations since we're doing a simple WHERE equivalent, basically save them CUs! Make sure to set your destination to your Lakehouse / Warehouse (wherever you want!) by visiting Home &gt; Add data destination, and setting the update method to Append and select Publish.</p> <p>Of note, Publish will both publish the Dataflow and start the refresh activity, you may want to manually update the date within the Warehouse by executing the stored procedure once the dataflow refresh has completed to avoid duplication of results.</p> <p></p> <p>Next, we\u2019ll create a Data pipeline and in the bottom portion of the screen, we\u2019ll select Variables and then New to create the three variables listed below.</p> Name Type Default Value IncrementValue Integer 1 DateValue String (leave as null) MaxRange Integer 1 <p>In our example, the IncrementValue will be used to set how many days we will incrementally count by, the DateValue will be used to store the date value from our Warehouse and MaxRange to set how many days we want this to run in a single instance. (For instance, if we want to increment by 1 day with a maximum period of up thirty times, we will grab 30 days\u2019 worth of information on pipeline run.)</p> <p></p> <p>Add a\u00a0Script activity\u00a0to the Data pipeline. In the\u00a0Settings\u00a0configuration, select the Warehouse name in the Data warehouse section and set the Script to Query.

You might be wondering, \"What's the big deal?\" Well, let's dive into and dissect the backend staging setup of dataflows in the Lakehouse. Close your eyes and imagine countless system tables, each tagged with lengthy identifiers that intertwine with your actual query names\u2014think\u00a0<code>some-random-crazystring_Address_002E.parquet</code>. And within these auxiliary tables? YOUR DATA alongside generic column titles like Column1, Column2, Column3 (metadata too! don't worry your column names aren't lost!). But every single query leveraging staging, is using this backend implementation approach - ultimately contributing to data sprawl in my opinion.</p> <p></p> <p>Now that your curiosity is piqued, let's take a slight detour and delve deeper into the world of dataflows.</p> <p>Embracing Dataflow Gen2 without altering your approach from Dataflow Gen1 is a path I STRONGLY want you to reconsider. Hold the \"but, but, but!\" and hear me out. I understand the familiarity of 'Get data &gt; from Dataflow' in Power BI, Excel, and Power Apps. I've been there, it's awesome, but I'm now pleading STOP doing it that way.</p> <p>\"Tried and true - why change?\" Ok, here's my issue: if you skip setting a data destination, the \"Dataflow\" connector in Power BI, Excel, and Power Apps pulls data directly from the DataflowsStagingLakehouse. This might seem small, but I consider it a significant issue. Don't believe me, check out the images and Power Query M script below, they should look familiar.</p> <p></p> <p>Power Query script:</p> <pre><code>let\n    Source = PowerPlatform.Dataflows(null),\n    Workspaces = Source{[Id = \"Workspaces\"]}[Data],\n    #\"WorkspaceId\" = Workspaces{[workspaceId = \"CrazyWorkspaceID\"]}[Data],\n    #\"DataflowId\" = #\"WorkspaceId\"{[dataflowId = \"CrazyDataflowId\"]}[Data],\n    #\"NoStage\" = #\"DataflowId\"{[entity = \"NoStage\", version = \"\"]}[Data]\nin\n    #\"NoStage\"\n</code></pre> <p>Ok, so let me go through my \"airing of grievances\"...</p> <ul> <li> <p>The\u00a0DataflowsStagingLakehouse\u00a0is hidden away from the workspace UI, making it a challenge to access from a business standpoint. Sure, you can use the OneLake data hub, client tools can bridge the gap to connect to the workspace's SQL endpoint or scripting options, but not being able to easily see this in your workspace list just introduces additional complexity and work arounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>The table names are a complex maze of non-intuitive identifiers. Despite the metadata file in Power BI, Excel, or Power Apps providing clarity with actual table and column name values when connecting... it's simply too disconnected from one tool to the next what gets displayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>While garbage clean-up operations occur for removed queries from your original dataflow definition or when the dataflow item is deleted.

Basically, these seemingly arbitrary tables aren't just adding clutter and complexity \u2014they're incurring storage costs within OneLake. (Yes, really!). Luckily, though you've already bought into the gospel of data destinations and only using staging when appropriate to achieve that incredible scale with Dataflows Gen2 - AMAZING! But please, don't stop reading just yet - let's actually start solving this problem. How? Delete the tables - every. single. time.</p> <p>Putting the pieces together:</p> <p>First let's start with our dataflow, highlighting three key components and their associated numbers in the image below:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Staged queries: Identified by their standard text format, these queries are earmarked for staging. A simple right-click reveals the \"Enable staging\" option in the context menu, confirming their destination: the DataflowsStagingLakehouse within the workspace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-staged queries: These stand out in italicized text, signifying a direct data stream from the original source to the designated data destination, courtesy of the Mashup engine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Computed Tables: These are the powerhouses, leveraging both the DataflowsStagingLakehouse and DataflowsStagingWarehouse. They execute large-scale data transformations using the Fabric warehouse. Note that without a specified data destination, these queries default back to the DataflowsStagingLakehouse, underscoring the importance of proper configuration.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Once the dataflow is in place, we'll manage the refresh and subsequent cleanup through a Data pipeline, complemented by the Notebook activity. Begin by integrating the dataflow activity, ensuring the correct dataflow is selected. For this scenario, I'll employ the \"On completion\" conditional path. This ensures that even if a dataflow encounters a partial failure, any successfully created tables and their data will still be removed from the underlying DataflowsStagingLakehouse.</p> <p></p> <p>Navigating through the Notebook's explorer, select\u00a0Data sources &gt; Lakehouses\u00a0and then\u00a0Existing lakehouse. In the OneLake data hub interface, use the search function with the string \"StagingLakehouse.\" You'll encounter a multitude of lakehouses; identify the correct one for your workspace using the\u00a0Location\u00a0column and then select Add.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you're in the Notebook and within the Lakehouse explorer, you'll notice those system tables created for the staged queries are now visible. If you remember the queries without staging enabled are sent straight to their intended data destination, so you may not see the same number of tables in this area. To clear out the unnecessary tables though, insert the PySpark script provided below into a code block, which will purge all tables within the 'DataflowsStagingLakehouse' schema.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Initialize Spark Session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"DeleteTables\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Set the schema name\nschema_name = 'DataflowsStagingLakehouse'\n\n# List all tables in the schema\ntables = spark.sql(f\"SHOW TABLES IN {schema_name}\").collect()\n\n# Delete each table\nfor table in tables:\n    table_name = table['tableName']\n    spark.sql(f\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {schema_name}.{table_name}\")\n    print(f\"Deleted table {table_name}\")\n\n# Stop the Spark Session\nspark.stop()\n</code></pre> <p>Add another activity to your data pipeline by visiting Activities and then selecting Script. Within the Settings select the More option to launch the Get data experience.</p> <p></p> <p>In the Get data experience select OneLake data hub, use the search function with the string \"StagingWarehouse.\" You'll encounter a multitude of warehouses; identify the correct one for your workspace using the\u00a0Location\u00a0column and then select the correct row option to continue.</p> <p></p> <p>Within the Script activity configure the conditional path as \"On completion\" between the Notebook and Script activities before pasting the following code block below the image.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX) = '';\n\n-- Generate the DROP TABLE statements for all tables in the dbo schema\nSELECT @sql += 'DROP TABLE ' + QUOTENAME(TABLE_SCHEMA) + '.' + QUOTENAME(TABLE_NAME) + '; '\nFROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES\nWHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dbo' AND TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE';\n\n-- Execute the generated DROP TABLE statements\nEXEC sp_executesql @sql;\n</code></pre> <p>Before you run the data pipeline, conduct a thorough review to ensure that your Dataflow, Notebook, and Script activities are properly set up and ready to rock-and-roll. Once you're confident everything is ready, go ahead and Run the data pipeline.</p> <p></p> <p>After the run, a quick check back in the Lakehouse explorer within the Notebook will reveal an empty Tables section. And just like that, we've taken out our own garbage, thank you very much!</p> <p></p> <p>This topic has been a nagging one for me, and fortunately I had a nudge by colleagues to address lingering confusion. Ideally, dataflows would streamline this process by automating the clean-up process upon each successful refresh. Unfortunately, as of publication, that's not the case. The additional storage costs in my personal opinion are an unnecessary burden, and I'm sure you'd agree that data should be housed in its rightful destination, not lost in this staging purgatory. The advantages of always using data destinations are countless too: from sharing individual tables to bolstering security with Lakehouse/Warehouse integration, and simplifying overall management.</p> <p>While this article may not be the complete turnkey solution, it aims to understand and inspire. I envision some community contributor will propose a more sophisticated solution, with parameterized notebooks and invoked pipelines that turn this into a completely reusable process across the entire tenant.</p> <p>For right now though, there's some dirty lakes (and warehouses) that need cleaning!</p> <p>Shout out to /r/MicrosoftFabric user Automatic-Escape5053 for the comments and contributon improvements to this article as well!</p>","tags":["data-factory","microsoft-fabric"]},{"location":"blog/2024/10/25/thats-so-meta/","title":"That's So Meta","text":"<p>I don't know about you, but my goodness, wouldn't it be great to press Close &amp; Apply on Power Query and instantly have all of your columns documented in your model based on metadata definitions in your query?
